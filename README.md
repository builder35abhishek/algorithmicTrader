# algorithmicTrader
This is my first project on algorithmic trading with the use of reinforcement learning. I've designed this as an automated function that could be run on the cloud and simulate actual trading. Though this project doesn't account for transaction costs and price increases/decrases when buying/selling, it does a decent job at approximating real time trading.
